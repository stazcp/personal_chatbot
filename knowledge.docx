More details about me:
Welcome, My name is Staz.
Which is short for Anastasis which means resurrection in Greek
and yes I am Greek but also a US Citizen. I am a Frontend (mostly) engineer and have been working with React and Typescript mainly.

In my free time I like to learn about new technologies,
like crypto and AI,
read books sometimes about development, others about leadership, and other times about science, the natural world and finally science fiction.

Fun Facts:
I used to be a Paratrooper Sniper in Greek Special Forces, I love mountaineering, I used to be a high-end mixologist at Michelin Rated restaurants,
 and I used to own my own beach bar in Greece.
 I have also sold solar for Tesla.


Challenges I have encountered and how I dealt with them:

**working at dv01**
- Our app had a legacy drawer system where we were sending components from one part of the app to another,
the state management was horrible as well as the Drawer code. Very monolythic and hard to work with.
During a discovery phase (design sprint), while working on a POC for another long-term project I decided that 
we were going to need to finally refactor the Drawer state and create a new component into our Component system.
I created a brand new drawer using framer motion, with intelligent reactivity including some sidebars that expand
that the drawer needs to be aware of and move out of the way on it's own. The component was very much plug and play 
as well as the state management solution, where I created a hook using the messenger pattern and any other drawer 
that is open will close before opening a new one solving the double drawer problem and not having to register in
state all the drawers or have any complex state management. The new Drawer was so easy to use by importing the 
component from our Component Library and plugging it in the new useDrawer hook.
- We have a PEOD (Product Engineer On Duty) rotation which lasts for a week. Every time I have to address novel bugs
and customer requests that are time-sensitive, although I do get great support from the team. I have to solve multiple
hard bugs at times in a time-efficient manner. The solution has to be fast, and efficient and should not cause any new bugs.
During such shifts, I have to solve very difficult problems at times and very quickly (within 24 hours) and deliver to 
the user in a timely manner.

**working at breathing.ai**
- I was building a Chrome extension and I wanted a live stream of video from the user's webcam 
going into an AWS server where we had a machine learning function (Lambda) that would process the user's 
images into an S3 bucket and return the breathing and heart rate of the user to the front end.
We will later use this data to present to the user a meditation or 
breathing technique to calm the user down when they are using the computer for long periods.
 This would help users to increase productivity while reducing stress when working long hours
on a computer especially when they are working remotely. The challenge was to get an accurate reading
of the HR and BR by increasing the FPS without having a large cost and slowing down the browser.
I had to hire contractors from abroad that I worked with they build the pipeline, while I connected
the Frontend parts to have this feature working.
- I built a new login/signup screen for our app overnight working up to 7 am to show off our 
app at a tech event in Portugal "Web Summit". Our presentation was at 7.30 am at my time, so I completed,
deployed and tested the flow 30 minutes before the presentation. Thankfully everything went smoothly.
- Had to assign Tasks to new hires that were Junior level and lead them on how to produce good code 
that I won't have to refactor later. So the challenge was as I was not a senior yet, to provide leadership 
and guidance to other engineers.
- Built a Data Layer using Google Tag Manager (Which I completed a course for). This Data Layer was
used to get insights about our users and how they interact with the App. I also Led the team
on how to use the Data Layer and GTM, as well as which components and how they should be configured
to derive good analytics.

**working as a freelancer**
- Provided consulting for a Government Organization in building a web app with React/Typescript.
I was not legally allowed to touch the code so I taught the staff how to work with React and Typescript 
via videocalls and helped them build and deploy a feature.
- Created and Built multiple web applications using WordPress and custom components for various clients.
The biggest challenge was getting clients and building quickly what they needed. I had a partner
where he would be more of a designer and WordPress specialist while I had better experience
with coding, creating custom components and creating projects that would stand out.

**other**
- when I was applying for my current job, while on vacation I was asked to develop a React App 
that would aggregate data from a CSV and display it to the user with some charts and filters.
The project was an interview challenge. I had 3 hours to complete the task which I did while on the road
and passed the challenge.

Openness to Relocation and remote work:
Staz has been working remotely most of his career in California and he enjoys remote work, 
he is also willing to work in an office for the right position. He may be also willing to 
relocate under the right circumstances, relocation assistance would defenatelly help. 

References:
Staz has multiple positive references. Here are a few.
- David Shin-Software Engineer
  I was very fortunate to have the pleasure of working with Staz for a year and I can say that, without a doubt, he helped me become a better worker and coder. He is full of charisma and brings so much energy to the team. During crunch time, he was always available, regardless of where he was in the world and what time it was. He sets realistic goals and operates with precision to meet tough deadlines. He's a powerhouse of knowledge and charisma and wherever Staz ends up next, they're insanely lucky to have him.
- Panas KollasPanas Kollas - CEO & President, UNISCRAP PBC
  Staz is a charismatic leader, and he has tremendous vision skills. He is a hard worker and we are very satisfied from the results of our cooperation and partnership. We recommend to the global community to work with Staz.
- Sarah SheikhSarah Sheikh Project Manager
  Staz is a thorough Frontend developer. He has excellent knowledge of his domain and is an expert at what he does. He meets deadlines and has a well rounded personality. I definitely recommend to work with Staz in the future. 
- Arvin BehshadArvin Behshad - Providing Mobile App DevelopmentProviding Mobile App Development
  I got in touch with Staz and offered to mentor him after I found that he was looking for help with coding. I introduced a complete plan for him that would end in him being ready work as a junior frontend developer. We started meeting in weekly calls to go over his progress with the homework that I gave him. I was really impressed by Staz's resilience and independence. He would constantly challenge himself by dreaming bigger and going the extra mile with the features in his web app - both great traits for a developer. He would not back away when not knowing the answer, instead he would spend hours searching until he would find it. I think Staz is a great addition to any frontend development team.
