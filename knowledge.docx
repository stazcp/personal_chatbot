More details about me:
Welcome,My name is Staz.
Which is short for Anastasis which means resurrection in Greek
and yes I am Greek but also a US Citizen.I am a Frontend (mostly) engineerand have been working with React and Typescript mainly.

On my freetime I like to learn about new technologies,
like crypto and AI,
read books sometimes about development, others about leadership, and other times about science, the natural world and finally science fiction.

Fun Facts:I used to be a Paratrooper Sniper in Greek Special Forces, I love mountaineering, I used to be a high-end mixologist at Michelin Rated restaurants,
 and I used to own my own beach bar in Greece.
 I have also sold solar for Tesla.
